HW8 INSTRUCTIONS

Read the assignment sheet thoroughly.

You must do the preparation questions before you begin programming!

Study the example hw8demo.out
and the input/output table format examples.

This HW shows how easy it is to change el_t
to have multiple parts in it.  
We need to define el_t in elem.h and elem.cpp to do this.

PLEASE STUDY the files very carefully!!!!!

Copy your llist and slist files here and
update them first:
 cp ../forHW7/llist.* . 
 cp ../forHW7/slist.* . 
1) el_t is now a class so remove typedef but
   #include elem.h
2) copy search as search2 and update search2 so
   that it returns the found element
   itself (el_t) and not the position 
   (if not found, returns a completely blank el_t)

Read the .h files to learn all the functions in .cpp

Complete elem.cpp, htable.cpp and hw8client.cpp including good comments.

Create your own input file with element parts per line!

MUST TEST VERY THROUGHLY!!!!!!!
